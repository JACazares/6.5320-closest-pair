python closest_point.py
```

## Overview
There are three components to this.

_algorithm.py_: Contains the code for the closest pair algorithm, runs in $O(N \lg^2 N)$, yields at every step where we need to update the image

_draw_state.py_: Contains the ```draw_state``` function, which is used to draw the points and subsequent necessary lines, halfplanes, stripes, depending on which part of the algorithm we are currently executing

_closest_point.py_: Contains the code to draw the main menu window, alongside button functionality and graphical point input.
